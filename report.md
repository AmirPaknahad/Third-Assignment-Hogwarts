## How I write this program
First of everything, my AP mentor forced me to code this project and I never do that by my own desire. <br />
At the beginning, I read the readme file in our AP GitHub account that explain the project. after that I realized I have to learn about hash, uuid and some details about classes in Java. so I started watching videos in YouTube. first, I went for learn more about classes. then I watched some hash videos from Jadi. after that I start coding from classes and completed them. After tasting the methods, I made a menu for my code. unfortunately, I didn't have much time to learn about javaFx to run the code in a graphical environment. At the end, I went for writing readme that you are now reading it.
